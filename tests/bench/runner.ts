/**
 * akm-bench K-seed runner (spec §5 + §6).
 *
 * `runUtility(options)` is the single entry point used by both the CLI
 * dispatcher (`tests/bench/cli.ts utility`) and unit tests. It expands the
 * caller's `(tasks × arms × seeds)` cartesian product, calls `runOne` for
 * each triple, splices the trajectory record back in, and returns a
 * `UtilityRunReport` that `renderUtilityReport` can stamp into JSON +
 * markdown.
 *
 * Per-(arm, seed) isolation:
 *   • Workspace: each (task, arm, seed) gets a fresh tmp dir seeded from the
 *     task's `workspace/` template so runs cannot pollute each other.
 *   • Stash: only the `akm` arm materialises a stash via `loadFixtureStash`.
 *     We materialise once per task (the stash content is identical across
 *     the K seeds) and reuse it.
 *
 * Cleanup: every tmp resource is wrapped in `try/finally`. We never leak
 * tmp dirs even on harness exceptions.
