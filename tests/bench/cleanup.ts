/**
 * Shared cleanup registry for the bench harness (#267).
 *
 * The bench creates many tmp directories — per (task, arm, seed) workspace,
 * per-task fixture stash, per-fixture evolveStash + preStash. Each of these
 * is wrapped in a try/finally so happy-path runs leave nothing behind. But
 * an external SIGINT/SIGTERM (operator hits Ctrl-C, CI cancels the job)
 * bypasses `finally` blocks entirely on Bun, leaving orphan tmp dirs under
 * the bench tmp root (#276 redirected this from the OS temp dir to
 * `${AKM_CACHE_DIR}/bench/`) that nothing reaps.
 *
 * `registerCleanup(fn)` captures the cleanup intent on a process-wide
 * registry and returns a deregister function. The first `registerCleanup`
 * call also installs ONE pair of SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers — subsequent calls
 * never re-install. On signal we walk every registered fn (swallowing
 * errors), remove our own listeners (so a second Ctrl-C force-exits), and
 * `process.exit(130)`.
 *
 * The handler is idempotent: re-entrant signals while cleanup is in flight
 * are dropped. Per-tmp `try/finally` callers should:
 *   1. Register the cleanup at the top of `try`.
 *   2. Deregister it in `finally` *before* running cleanup themselves so the
 *      handler doesn't double-fire.
 *
 * Garbage-collection of orphan dirs (#276): the FIRST `registerCleanup` call
 * also sweeps `${AKM_CACHE_DIR}/bench/*` entries older than 6h. This catches
 * orphans from prior crashed runs that bypassed `finally`. Subsequent calls
 * never re-sweep — the GC is install-once.
