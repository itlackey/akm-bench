/**
 * Central registry for asset type renderer and action builder maps.
 *
 * Previously these maps lived in `db-search.ts` (then `local-search.ts`) and
 * were wired into `asset-spec.ts` via a fragile `_setAssetTypeHooks` deferred
 * callback pattern. If the search module was imported after
 * `registerAssetType()` calls, hooks would be silently dropped.
 *
 * This module is a simple singleton that both `asset-spec.ts` and
 * `db-search.ts` import from, eliminating the import-order dependency
 * entirely.
